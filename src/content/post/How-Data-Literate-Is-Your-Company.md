With the rise of big data, it's [becoming increasingly important](https://polarpacket.com/blog/5-reasons-why-data-analytics-is-important/) for companies to have a data-literate workforce. Being data literate means having the skills to analyze and interpret data effectively, as well as the ability to communicate insights to others. 
In today's business landscape, where data-driven decision-making is essential for staying competitive, having a data-literate workforce can [make or break a company](https://polarpacket.com/blog/why-is-data-literacy-important-for-businesses/). 
This article will help you to assess how data literate your company is. 

1.Employee data literacy skills
Data literacy starts with the employees. Begin by assessing their data literacy skills through surveys, skills assessments, or observing their ability to work with data. 
Examples of data literacy skills include the ability to collect, clean, and analyze data, as well as the ability to interpret data visualizations and communicate insights to others. 

2.Data culture 
Creating a data-literate culture is essential for building a data-driven company. A data culture is a set of values, behaviours and practices that prioritize the use of data to inform decision-making. 
Look at the extent to which your employees use data to inform decision-making, the quality and accuracy of the data being used, and the degree to which leadership prioritises data-driven decision-making. 

3.Data infrastructure
Data infrastructure refers to the technical systems, tools and processes used to manage, store and analyze data.
Evaluate whether your company’s current data infrastructure can support your data literacy goals, handle the volume and complexity of your data, and whether your tools and systems are up-to-date and easy to use. 
Examples of strong data infrastructure include cloud-based storage solutions, data management platforms, and business intelligence tools. 

4.Data-driven decision-making
Data-driven decision-making is the practice of using data to [inform and validate decisions](https://polarpacket.com/blog/how-is-data-analytics-applied-in-business/). 
Evaluate the extent to which data is used in decision-making processes, the quality and accuracy of the data being used, and the effectiveness of your data analysis and interpretation methods. 

5.Training and support 
How often do your employees receive training and support to improve and refresh their data literacy skills? 
Offer access to data tools, resources, and ongoing training to help your employees use data effectively in their roles. Providing consistent training and ongoing support can also help foster a culture of data literacy in your organization.

The Bottom Line 
So, how data literate do you think your company is? 
By investing in improving your employee data literacy skills, data culture, data infrastructure, data-driven decision-making, and training, your company can unlock the true potential of data.
